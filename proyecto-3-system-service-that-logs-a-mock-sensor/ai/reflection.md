# Reflection on AI-Assisted Development

Throughout this assignment, I used an AI assistant primarily as a **support tool for refinement and validation**, rather than as a direct code generator. My goal was to combine my own implementation with AI-driven suggestions to improve clarity, maintainability, and documentation quality.

---

## What I Asked
I mainly consulted the AI on:
- Strategies for making shell scripts and test cases more consistent and user-friendly.  
- Recommendations for improving the readability and structure of the documentation (`README.md`).  
- Best practices for sequencing automated tests and ensuring that log outputs were visible during service execution.  

I intentionally avoided asking for complete implementations. Instead, I focused on **targeted prompts** for review and improvement of work I had already drafted.

## What I Accepted vs. Rejected
- **Accepted:**  
  - Reordering certain tests so that log monitoring occurs at the correct time.  
  - Replacing emoji-based error messages with clearer text descriptions.  
  - Expanding the documentation to include practical usage examples and build instructions.  

- **Rejected:**  
  - Overly detailed suggestions that made the README too long.  
  - Additions that introduced unnecessary complexity (e.g., clickable file links that didnâ€™t add real value).  

This selective approach helped me maintain **control over the project direction** while benefiting from AI input.

## How I Validated Outputs
- **Manual Testing:** After each change in the test scripts, I ran them locally to confirm expected behavior.  
- **Cross-Checking Documentation:** I verified that all steps in the README actually matched the build and service management process.  
- **Iterative Review:** I compared AI suggestions with my own reasoning and only kept the ones that aligned with the assignment requirements.

## Lessons Learned
This process reinforced the importance of using AI as a **collaborative partner** rather than a replacement for my own work. By critically evaluating suggestions, I could enhance the quality of the project while ensuring originality and correctness. The final result is a more polished and professional assignment that still reflects my personal effort and decision-making.
